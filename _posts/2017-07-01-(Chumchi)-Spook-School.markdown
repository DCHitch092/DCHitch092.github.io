Adam Todd from Spook School looking cheeky.

The concept for the video came from the very popular marble race videos at the time. Niall from the band contacted me with this idea about having a very fun race, where members of the band were killed off along the race, but in a fun way, with paint instead of blood. We filmed the video around Edinburgh's Blackford Hill in an afternoon, and the video was completed in a couple of days.  

At ChumChi designs we are able to produce content for any project, even if you haven't come up with it yet. With a background in comedy performance and writing, we are able to inject humour into any project - and importantly, pull it off.
