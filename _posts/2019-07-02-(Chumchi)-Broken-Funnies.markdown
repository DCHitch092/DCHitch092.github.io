Play written by Martin Bearne
Directed by Andrew Sim
Original Photography by Trudy Stade
Design by ChumChi Designs

Martin's play, about making his therapist laugh, required a design inspired by psychoanalysis, and in terms of visual design, the clear direction was to adapt the famous Rorschach Tests (an ink blot technique that creates indiscernible/ephemeral shapes that are up tot he viewer to interpret). We experimented with this and using clever masking and digital painting, we created this.
