Vladimir McTavish - 60 Minutes To Save The World
18:50 The Standâ€™s New Town Theatre - Studio
August 1-25th (not 13th) 2019

Photography by Richard Hanrahan

Vladimir McTavish's brief was simple - make me a superhero. We did a great little photoshoot in the streets of Edinburgh, trying to remember between us exactly what superheroes actually look like and do, and captured that experience. I took some inspiration from various comic book covers I could assemble, especially in terms of colour choices, font and shape.
