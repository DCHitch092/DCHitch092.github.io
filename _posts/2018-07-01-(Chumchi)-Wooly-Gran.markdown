Woolly Gran is a community interest company which uses traditional textile-based crafts to help elderly artists keep their brains and hands active. I've been working with Rachel Stewart to help build a digital presence for Woolly Gran, including assisting her i nre-developing the logo, website and online catalogue.
The project helps artists sells work produced by "grans" through online services or in markets and stalls, and uses that money to fund further work, giving a much needed creative outlet for those that need it. These photos were taken for an Easter collection, designed to showcase the new professional direction that the project was taking.
