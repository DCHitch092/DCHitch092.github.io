This was a little project I helped my wife with. It is a rudimentary design using SquareSpace. It is not a particularly, and in no way demonstrates my current abilities as a software developer BUT it does offer some of my previous web design experience, especially demonstrating my familiarity with using a CMS platform that you, as a potential customer, may already be familiar.

It's an [excellent blog though](http://MochaTheWeek.com), you should take a look. The logos we designed together - she drew, I graphic designed.
