#This Train Terminates Here.

Photography by Edward Moore (Ed Shots)

Laughing Horse @ Cabaret Voltaire - Long Room 15:50 Aug 1-11, 13-25

A comedy show about definitely not wanting kids... I think? The second debut hour from the childless BBC New Comedy Award finalist and presenter of BBC Brit’s Socially Awkward Situations. Previous praise: ‘Refreshingly intelligent stand-up that also manages to be achingly funny’ (Young-Perspective.net). ‘So bloody good’ (Skinny). ‘Hugely confident, hugely slick… a welcome offbeat, slightly geeky sensibility’ (Bruce Dessau).
