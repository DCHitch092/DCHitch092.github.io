So this is where I write my first blog post. I'm just coming to the end of my time with CodeClan, which has been fantastic. During this 16 week course I've learned to code with Ruby, Javascript and Java, and built apps on a regular basis. I'm now ready to move into work as a junior software developer, confident with the tools at my disposal - but excited to build on this knowledge!
