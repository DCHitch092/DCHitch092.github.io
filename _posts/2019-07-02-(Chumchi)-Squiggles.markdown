In late 2018 friend and The Spook School's drummer Niall McCamley (in that order) approached me about a new idea he had. It was for a project, well he called it a cult, called Squiggles which he could hand out to people at gigs so they could feel less alone and part of something bigger. What's emerged is a DIY Pop Punk Behemoth with a penchant for discussing mental health issues while Niall dresses as a pink superhero.
Design wise, Niall wanted it to have a big long messy tangled string, and maybe some hearts and some moustaches. I of course obliged.
