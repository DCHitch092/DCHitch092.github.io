### Background
I've been a performer for years, with well over 10 years taking various projects to the Edinburgh Festival. Currently, performers get a bum deal - they perform 25 times, flyering all day to fill venues, and collect money from ticket revenue or from a bucekt collecting donations at the end of the show. 

### The Problem
